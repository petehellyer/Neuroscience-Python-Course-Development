# Pre-material for fMRI Skill
## Introduction to Python programming and statistics

Welcome to the pre-material for the **fMRI Skill**! The aim of the material is to introduce you to `programming in Python` and to `statistics`. If you already have experience with programming and/or statistics, then this will be an easy review. If not, it will give you the necessary foundation to be able to explore programming in Python, as well as provide you with the neccisary skills to complete the 4 workshop activities in the fMRI Skill.

```
Read the instructions carefully before starting the lectures
```

You are expected to go trough the material in the following order:

1.. **Device set-up**: there are two documents called `Setup-Windows` and `Setup-Mac`. Follow the instructions in the document that correspond to your operative system. If you have any questions about the set-up specifically, please email **peter.hellyer@kcl.ac.uk** with the subject line PRE_MATERIALS

2 **Introduction to Python**: we prepared 10 separate lectures on the most important concepts of programming in Python. The lecture are called LectureN (where N correspond to the number of the lecture) and are already in the order in which you should complete them.
    
> **IMPORTANT**: don't skip lectures, but do follow the order we provided, because following lectures are based on previously taught material.

> **IMPORTANT 2**: The lecture are characterised by a combination of *pratical theory* and *code here* sections. The *code here* sections require you to apply what you have learnt in the lectures through small exercises.

A summary of the lectures' topics is provided in the following Table.
